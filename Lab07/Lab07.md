3. Steps to download an ISO: I choose the Ubuntu Desktop as my iso, I downloaded it from the Ubuntu website. 
4. Steps to use ISO on VM: When asked to choose ISO in my VM set up, I selected the Ubuntu Desktop from my download folder where it was placed in after download.
5. Steps to install your distribution: Since I used Virtual Box 7.0, it took care of the distribution and other installations.
6. Steps to boot to disk after install: In Oracle right click on your VM, select settings, go to System, under motherboard tab, move the boot order items using the arrows after you select the item you want to move (Make sure you VM is off!!).

1. Steps to change desktop background: Right click on desktop screen, select change background, choose background.
2. Steps to open a web browser: click on firefox(takes time to open up), I skipped the beginning steps to set it up and went straight to browsing and went to Pilot.
3. Steps to install VSCode: When I first set up my VM it gave me recommendations of what to install based on my current system, so I selected to install VSCode.
4. Steps to connect to your AWS instance from your VM: I installed ubuntu and went through the same steps as Lab1 and connected to my aws instance, using my key and line of code I use on my main desktop to enter my aws instance.
